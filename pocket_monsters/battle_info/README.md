If you played any of the Pokemon games, you know that there are always annoying Trainers scattered along the routes who interrupt you while you're trying to explore. 

These Trainers tend to only have Pokemon of a certain "type", i.e. "Bugcatcher Ryan" only has grass type Pokemon. I'm curious if there is one type that is more advantageous than the others.
If you were to encounter one of these Trainers, which type would be the hardest to defeat? Which type is the most successful in battle?

Let's find out!
